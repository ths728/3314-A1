We import the package matplotlib.pyplot and numpy for this assignment. We will use plt for ploting scatterplots and use arrange() function from numpy to generate a continuous set of parameters for each situtation. \\
All codes are tpyed in the forward order, they should be run properly. Be careful, training errors and testing errors for each section are named the same. Therefore, the previous errors will be overwrited by the new generated errors.
